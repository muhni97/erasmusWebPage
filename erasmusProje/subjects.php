Depending on the complexity of the subject, its influence on the achievement of study results, the components of the cumulative assessment of the subject and the values ​​of j coefficients are determined by the subject teacher. The teacher of each study subject determines and informs the students at the beginning of the semester about the influence (percentage) of each component (task, work) on the final assessment and formulates the assessment criteria for each intermediate task.
